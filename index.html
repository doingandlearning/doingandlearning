After 8 years of running Hollyhock Lane I have come to the decision that I think it’s time to shut up shop. This has definitely not been an easy decision to make, but after giving birth to our third child in February 2020, I have decided that it feels right to extend my maternity leave and have a season of focusing on the kids whilst they are all so little. My leave has coincided with the covid pandemic and it goes without saying that the pandemic has hit the wedding industry hard and the huge reduction in business has make this tricky decision a little easier.

I have loved developing my designs and running the business over the years, but it also feels time to end one chapter and begin another.
</p>
        <p>
I have no doubt that as the little ones grow I will set my hands to new creative ventures - I already have the sketchbook out!

For any clients that have had to delay weddings due to covid, myself and Kim will make sure that all booked work is completed, please just get in touch via the Hollyhock Lane instagram account or pick up any previous email conversations we’ve had - we will be delighted to help.

Thank you to all who have supported me over the years - it’s been a great pleasure to run Hollyhock Lane.
